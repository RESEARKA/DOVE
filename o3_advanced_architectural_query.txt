# DOVE Token Architecture Refactoring Analysis

## Current Issues
I've refactored DOVE token to be more modular, but introduced circular dependency issues:
- DOVE.sol constructor creates DOVEGovernance, DOVEEvents, and DOVEInfo inline
- Tests are failing because this architecture makes proper initialization and testing difficult
- Breaking API compatibility with existing tests

## Smart Contract Best Practices Question
What is the most efficient way to refactor these DOVE token contracts to:

1. **Eliminate circular dependencies** while maintaining code under 300 lines per file?
2. **Implement proper dependency injection** instead of inline contract creation?
3. **Create a clean two-phase initialization pattern** that allows for testability?
4. **Maintain API compatibility** with existing tests that expect functions directly on the DOVE contract?

## Contract Structure (Current)
```solidity
// In DOVE.sol constructor
_governanceContract = IDOVEGovernance(address(new DOVEGovernance(adminContract)));
_eventsContract = new DOVEEvents();
_infoContract = new DOVEInfo(...);
```

Please provide specific code examples showing:
1. Proper constructor patterns
2. Initialization sequence
3. How to maintain API compatibility while using a modular design
4. Best deployment sequence for testability

This is CRITICAL to avoid repeating previous architectural failures in our token project.
