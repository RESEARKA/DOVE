Please review my DOVE token implementation for any potential security issues, optimizations, or best practices:

Main components:
1. DOVE.sol - Core ERC-20 token with reflection tax and early-sell tax
2. Reflection.sol - Library implementing non-iterative reflection mechanism
3. IDOVE.sol - Interface defining external functions

Key features implemented:
- 1% reflection tax redistributed to token holders
- Early-sell tax (3%→2%→1%→0% over 72h from launch)
- Max transaction limits (0.2% rising to 0.5% after 24h)
- Non-iterative reflection mechanism for gas efficiency
- Owner controls for excluding/including accounts from fees
- Circuit breakers to disable features if needed

Please identify any:
1. Security vulnerabilities or potential exploits
2. Gas optimization opportunities 
3. Logical errors in the reflection mechanism
4. Compliance with ERC-20 standards
5. Best practices for deploying on Base L2

Provide specific code suggestions where improvements are needed.
