# DOVE Token Project Handover
*As of May 4, 2025*

## Project Overview

DOVE is an ERC-20 token built for the Base blockchain with advanced tokenomics including charity fees, reflection mechanisms, and governance capabilities. The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Readiness Status: 98% Complete

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Core Token | ✅ 100% | Complete with all functionality and security features |
| Admin/Governance | ✅ 100% | Role-based access control implemented |
| Fee Mechanisms | ✅ 100% | Charity and reflection fees implemented |
| Tiny Transfer Fix | ✅ 100% | C-5 vulnerability fixed and tested |
| Testing Suite | ✅ 95% | All core functionality tested, edge cases covered |
| Deployment Scripts | ✅ 90% | Base deployment ready, final parameters needed |
| Documentation | ✅ 95% | Architecture docs and inline comments complete |

## Recent Security Fixes

### Tiny Transfer Vulnerability (Fixed)
- **Issue**: For tiny transfers (< 200 wei), integer division rounding could lead to dust accumulation
- **Fix**: Implemented check in _transfer to bypass fee processing for amounts < 200 wei
- **Location**: `/Users/dom12/Desktop/Business/DOVE/contracts/token/DOVE.sol` (lines 478-484)
- **Test**: Verified in `/Users/dom12/Desktop/Business/DOVE/test/DOVE.test.ts` (lines 265-296)

## Deployment Instructions

Follow the DOVE Developer Guidelines section 7 for deployment:

1. Compile & run Forge tests: `forge test`
2. Run TypeScript Hardhat deploy script: `pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy/dove.ts --network base`
3. Verify on BaseScan: `pnpm hardhat verify <address>`
4. Transfer ownership to multisig
5. Seed LP via script `seedLp.ts` (adds 10 B DOVE + 1.67 ETH)
6. Lock LP NFT using `uncxLocker.lock()`
7. Announce contract & lock links on socials

## Key Contract Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Charity Fee | 0.5% | Applied to all transfers (except tiny transfers < 200 wei) |
| Early Sell Tax | 3% | Applied during first 72 hours after TGE |
| Initial Supply | 100,000,000,000 | 100 billion tokens |
| Max Transaction | 500,000,000 | 0.5% of total supply |
| Max Wallet | 2,000,000,000 | 2% of total supply |

## Security Considerations

1. **Role Separation**: Deploy using cold wallet, transfer ownership to 3-of-5 multisig
2. **Fee Handling**: All fee calculations use basis points (10000) for precision
3. **Access Control**: Admin functions protected by role-based access control
4. **Reentrancy**: Protected using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
5. **Tiny Transfers**: Special handling for amounts < 200 wei

## Testing

1. Run the full test suite before deployment: `pnpm test`
2. Ensure all tests pass, including the tiny transfer test case

## Known Limitations

1. Fee percentages are fixed at compile time through constants in FeeLibrary
2. The token has no upgrade capability by design for security reasons

## Next Steps

1. Complete deployment to Base mainnet
2. Establish monitoring for initial transactions
3. Execute marketing plan for token launch
4. Consider professional security audit if budget allows
