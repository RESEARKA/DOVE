Smart Contract Refactoring Analysis:

We've refactored our DOVE token ecosystem to improve modularity, but still have two files exceeding our 300-line limit:
1. DOVE.sol: 351 lines (17% over limit)
2. DOVEMultisig.sol: 326 lines (8.7% over limit)

From a security and smart contract best practices perspective:

1. Is it necessary to further refactor DOVE.sol by extracting view functions into a separate contract?
2. Should we also split DOVEMultisig.sol to meet the line limit, or is it acceptable at 326 lines?
3. What are the security tradeoffs between strict adherence to the line limit vs. maintaining logical cohesion?
4. Would adding more contract interactions through additional interfaces increase or decrease overall security?

Please provide specific reasoning for smart contract development in the DeFi/token context.
