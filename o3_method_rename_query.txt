Security and Consistency Analysis Question: I have renamed the method 'isDex' to 'getDexStatus' across all contracts (DOVE.sol, DOVEInfo.sol, DOVEFees.sol) and interfaces (IDOVE.sol, IDOVEInfo.sol). The parameter names have also been changed from 'isDex' to 'dexStatus' in relevant methods and events. 

1. Does this renaming cause any security, consistency or integration issues?
2. Are there any places where I might have missed updating references to the old method name?
3. Does this method name change follow best practices for Solidity naming conventions?
4. Could this change cause any problems when interacting with external contracts or front-end applications?
